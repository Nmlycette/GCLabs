# COFFEE SHOP PRODUCT LIST
Objectives: Databases and MVC

**Task:** In your MVC CoffeeShop, create a Product Index view which draws a list of products from ~~a SQL database~~ mock data. 
* From Scott 1/5: You do not need to tie into a database, you can mock the data in the controller the way we did for the Courses Controller

**What does the application do?**
1. The Product Index view shows a list of product names and prices.
2. Clicking on a product name takes you to a description page which lists all the information for that one product.

**Build Specifications**
~~- Create a new database with a Products table. ~~ At a minimum, include ID (autogenerated), name, description, price, and category.
~~- Use Entity Framework to connect to your database and generate your models and context.~~
- Add a ProductController with an Index action and view and a Detail action and view.
  - In the Index, make a link around each product name. Have the link go to the detail action, passing that objectâ€™s ID.

**Extended Challenges:**  
- Show a list of categories on the index view, then let the user click to see a list of only the products in that category.
- Send a Model to the detail view instead of sending the object through ViewData.
- In the Model, make a DAL object to handle all calls to the database, rather than building those into the Controller.

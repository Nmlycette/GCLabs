Task: Create a rock, paper, scissors game.

What will the application do?
	//● The application prompts the player to enter a name and select an opponent.
	//● The application prompts the player to select rock, paper, or scissors. 
		Then, the application displays the player’s choice, the opponent’s choice, and the result of the match.
	//● The application continues until the user doesn’t want to play anymore.
	//● If the user makes an invalid selection, the application should display an appropriate
	error message and prompt the user again until the user makes a valid selection.

Build Specifications:

	//1. Create an enumeration called Roshambo that has three values: rock, paper, and
	scissors.
	//2. Create an abstract class named Player that stores a name and a Roshambo value. This
	class should include a method named GenerateRoshambo that allows an inheriting
	class to generate and return a Roshambo value.
	//3. Create and name three player subclasses:
		//a. RockPlayer - Always throws Rock
		//b. RandomPlayer - Picks and throws a value at random
		//c. HumanPlayer - Allows the user to select and throw a value. 
				Upon creating an instance of this class, allow the user to input their name.
	//4. Create a HumanPlayer and then allow them to choose their opponent: either RockPlayer or RandomPlayer.
	//5. Validate your user inputs throughout your app. Try catch blocks, if statements, or any other method of validation is good.

Hints:

	//● Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper.

Extra Challenges:

	//● Create a Validator class to handle validation of all console input. It could have methods
	like GetYN (gets Y/y or N/n), GetOtherPlayer (accepts the names of your two players),
	GetRoshambo (accepts r/p/s and/or rock/paper/scissors).
	//● Keep track of wins and losses, and display them at the end of each session.
